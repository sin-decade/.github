We must admit, though, that this project is not written in C++ with Qt5. We
know, we know... it's painful for us too. But with a heavy heart, we made the
choice to pursue this path. Please bear with us as we do our best to make this
project a success and promise to avoid such deviant decisions in the future. We
sincerely apologize for any disappointment caused.

For now, the website features a delightful poem. However, we assure you that as
soon as there is something to share, we will post news about releases, projects,
and other exciting updates on the website. Stay tuned!
